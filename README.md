Made by [Giants](https://elrondgiants.com) & [NF-Tim](https://nf-tim.creative-tim.com/) by [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/)

**[Live Demo](https://mint-demo.elrondgiants.com/)**

This is a dApp template based on [erd-next-starter](https://github.com/Elrond-Giants/erd-next-starter) by [Giants](https://elrondgiants.com) & [soft-ui-dashboard-tailwind](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/soft-ui-dashboard-tailwind) by [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/).
The Minting Smart contract used in the live demo is [elven-nft-minter-sc](https://github.com/ElvenTools/elven-nft-minter-sc) by [Julian](https://twitter.com/JulianCwirko).

It offers authentication with Maiar App, Web Wallet, Extension, and Ledger. It also includes methods to easily sign and
make
transactions, query smart contracts, and a few utility methods.

This template can be used as a starting point for any minting dApp. It comes with the most common sections like:

- Header
- About us
- NFTs Carousel
- Roadmap
- Team
- FAQ

## Getting Started

#### Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Elrond-Giants/giants-nftim-minting-dapp.git
```

#### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Set the .env file

We have included the .env.development and .env.production files, which contain just elrond-specific environment
variables.

To interact with a minting smart contract, create your .env file and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
variable.

#### Launch and explore

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start exploring.

## How To's

#### Sign and send transaction

To make a transaction, simply use the hook `useTransction` and everything will be taken care for, from signing the
transaction to
status notifications.

Smart contract call:

```typescript
import { useTransaction } from "../hooks/useTransaction";
import { TransactionPayload } from "@elrondnetwork/erdjs/out";

const { makeTransaction } = useTransaction();
const txData = TransactionPayload.contractCall()
  .setFunction(new ContractFunction("SomeFunction"))
  .addArg(new BigUIntValue(10))
  .build();

await makeTransaction({
  receiver: "erd...",
  data: txData,
  value: 0.01,
});
```

#### Make query

To read data from the Smart Contract, like total number of NFTs, the price per NFT, etc, you can use a query.

```typescript
export const getTotalTokensLeft = async (): Promise<number> => {
  const { data: data } = await querySc(contractAddress, "getTotalTokensLeft", { outputType: "int" });

  return parseInt(data, 10);
};
```
